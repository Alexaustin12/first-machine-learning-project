# First Machine Learning Project
This was my first attempt at a machine learning project following this tutorial: 
https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/. I found the tutorial very straightforward and I highly recommend giving it a try! You can likely complete this even if you don't think your technical skills are high. All credit to Jason Brownlee for creating the initial tutorial.

I created a workshop using the tutorial here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6vtCfXSy93eM__P-I7mCer3EmYk2oqs2cwh5fZ7ek8/edit#slide=id.g50ea440cfb_0_4 The goal was to make this straightforward even someone who's never written a line of code. We gave the workshop to MBA students at UC Berkeley and had a lot of fun learning together - don't be intimidated, anyone can do it!
