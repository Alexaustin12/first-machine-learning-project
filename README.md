# first-machine-learning-project
This is my first attempt at a machine learning project following this tutorial: 
https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/. 

My goal is to add additional detail here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6vtCfXSy93eM__P-I7mCer3EmYk2oqs2cwh5fZ7ek8/edit#slide=id.g50ea440cfb_0_4 for any steps that might be confusing for someone who's never written a line of code. All credit to Jason Brownlee for creating the initial tutorial. I am documenting my attempt here for fun and in case it helps someone else.
